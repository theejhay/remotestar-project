# Task Description
Your task is to fill in the stubbed Property Searcher service to return correct results based on the input criteria.

The correct results are defined as such:

- All room options must be adjacent (and on the same floor) if the number of rooms is more than one.
- All room options should be returned within the minimum and maximum budget inclusive.
- Only rooms that are AVAILABLE should be returned.

## Examples

| Hotel A | False     | 1     | 1       | 25.80          |
| Hotel A | False     | 1     | 2       | 25.80          |
| Hotel A | True      | 1     | 3       | 25.80          |
| Hotel A | True      | 1     | 4       | 25.80          |
| Hotel A | False     | 1     | 5       | 25.80          |

## Instructions
To get you started, we've already provided a stubbed **Searcher** class with a method **search()** that accepts a rooms required count, minimum and maximum budget.

We have also provided an **add()** method that you will use to store properties in-memory such that they will be available in the call to **search()**.

As part of this assignment, we will need to see evidence that you have verified the
functionality of your solution.

We have already set up a composer.json file along with PHPUnit.
